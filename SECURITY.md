# Security Policy for Quick C++ Extension

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Quick C++ extension, please report it as soon as possible. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will work to address any issues promptly.

Please email us at **support@codegyan.in** or use the contact form on our official website. 

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to respond and provide a fix, to minimize the potential for misuse.

## Supported Versions

The Quick C++ extension follows a continuous improvement cycle, with the latest stable version receiving the most attention for security patches. We recommend users update to the latest release to benefit from ongoing security improvements.

- Current stable version: 0.0.1
- Older versions (if any) may no longer receive security updates.

## Security Best Practices

While the Quick C++ extension strives to maintain a high level of security, here are some best practices for ensuring your environment is as secure as possible when using it:

1. **Regularly update dependencies**: Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
2. **Limit user permissions**: Only provide the extension with the necessary permissions needed to execute, especially when running in production.
3. **Use strong input validation**: Always validate inputs from untrusted sources to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and format string issues.
4. **Memory management**: Ensure proper memory handling in your C++ code to prevent memory leaks and other issues that could be exploited.

## Security Fixes and Patches

We actively monitor security risks and release patches in a timely manner. All security-related patches will be listed under the "Release Notes" for the Quick C++ extension on our GitHub repository or official release page. Users should review the release notes to stay informed about the latest fixes.
